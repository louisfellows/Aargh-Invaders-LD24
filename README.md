Aargh-Invaders-LD24
====================

Code for Ludum Dare 24 entry, "Aargh, Invaders".

The code is a little messy and comments are a little hard to find, but this was all coded in a 48 hour period and the priority was making it work! May return to this and tidy it up a little in the future. 

It's also missing a few features such as 
	- Menu Screen
	- Player ship weapon powerups
	- More enemy movement and layout types
	- Player lives
	- High score table
	- Clearer evolution of enemies

Feel free to add to this! just remember to add your changes back into the repository!

Thanks for playing!
Louis
